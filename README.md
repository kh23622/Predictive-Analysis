# Predictive Analysis

This repository contains the analysis, code, and results from the project "Predictive Dunking: Machine Learning Insights into Biscuits Softening Dynamics in Tea." The project explores the structural properties of biscuits and their interactions with tea during the dunking process using machine learning techniques and optimization methods.

Project Overview
The aim of the project is to:

Classify biscuit types using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Analyze pore radius differences between biscuit types using microscopy data.
Evaluate the Washburn equation's accuracy and compare its performance with ML regressors.
Optimize predictive models for time-resolved datasets to improve prediction accuracy of tea absorption dynamics.
The project demonstrates how machine learning and traditional physical models can be used to gain insights into complex phenomena, with implications for both food science and manufacturing.
